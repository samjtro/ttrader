# ttrader

ttrader stands for terminal trader. I wanted to experiment with a terminal interface for trading through thinkorswim (using the fastest td-ameritrade hook [go-tda](https://github.com/samjtro/go-tda), utilizing a TUI (terminal user interface) portal updating every second with the following indicators:

- Implemented: PivotPoints (Support & Resistance), SMA, RMA, EMA, RSI, VWAP, MACD, BollingerBands
- WIP: Chaikin, IMI, MFI, PCR & OI

## WIP Features

- TUI using [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)
- TUI graphing using [asciigraph](https://github.com/guptarohit/asciigraph)

Happy Trading!
